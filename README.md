# IMPORTANT
**This program is based on** [libADLMIDI](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libADLMIDI)**. It has been modified by me to have better performance on the Raspberry Pi SBCs. Please note that you shout not contact the original creator of libADLMIDI if issues with this version appear. Fixing bugs in this fork is not part of his job as it is not maintained by him.**
